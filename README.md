Using the first innings data alone in the above data set, find the best fit 'run production functions' in terms of wickets-in-hand w and overs-to-go u. Assume the model Z(u,w) = Z0(w)[1 - exp{-Lu/Z0(w)}]. Use the sum of squared errors loss function, summed across overs, wickets, and data points for those overs and wickets.

Note that your regression forces all slopes to be equal at u = 0. You should provide a plot of the ten functions, and report the (11) parameters associated with the (10) production functions, and the normalised squared error (total squared error summed across overs, wickets, and data points for those overs and wickets, and normalised by the total number of data points across all overs and wickets) in your pdf file.
