Using the first innings data alone in the above data set, find the best fit 'run production functions' in terms of wickets-in-hand w and overs-to-go u. Assume the model Z(u,w) = Z0(w)[1 - exp{-Lu/Z0(w)}]. Use the sum of squared errors loss function, summed across overs, wickets, and data points for those overs and wickets.
